/* Supposedly the RDTIME instruction should be able to extract a constant time
 * monotonic timer.

 * See https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10.8/source/arch/riscv/include/asm/timex.h for Linux
 * code for this, which simply reads the underlying CSR.
 * The relevant CSRs are supposed to be visible from user-space.
 *
 * Note that the clang built in (__builtin_readcyclecounter()) does what it says on the tin
 * and reads the cycle counter which is not constant frequency or cross thread synchronized.
 * What we want it the clock which is constant and synchronized. (i.e. CSR 0xC01 rather than 0xC00).
 * 
 * For 32b code things are slightly more complex, since the value is across two 32b registers,
 * so one has to be careful of a race in which there's a carry between the two in-between reading
 * them... (So you must read hi, read low, read hi and compare with previous value; code for
 * this is all there).
